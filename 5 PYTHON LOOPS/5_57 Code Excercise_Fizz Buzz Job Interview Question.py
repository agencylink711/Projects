# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn and include number 100.
# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
# And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

target = 100

for n in range(1, target + 1):
    # The order matters: the if statements start checking from the top
    if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif n % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif n % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(n)
